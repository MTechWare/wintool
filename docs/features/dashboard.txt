Purpose: Implements the Dashboard tab. Provides a summary of system status, performance, and hardware details.

Key UI Elements (HTML):
- System Overview (OS, Hostname, User)
- Performance Monitoring (CPU, RAM, Disk usage, System uptime)
- Hardware Details (CPU/GPU model, temp, clock, load)

Styling:
- Card-based layout with grid for performance/hardware
- Accent color for key metrics and icons
- Custom scrollbars, responsive design

JavaScript Functionality (dashboard.js):
- `initDashboardTab()`: Initializes the dashboard, sets up periodic system info updates, hover animations.
- `updateSystemInfo()`: Fetches and updates all system and hardware metrics from Electron backend.
- `quickAction(action)`: Handles quick system actions (disk cleanup, task manager, power options, etc).
- `cleanupDashboardTab()`: Stops data polling when leaving tab.

Notes:
- Designed for quick system health/status overview. All metrics dynamically updated via JS.
