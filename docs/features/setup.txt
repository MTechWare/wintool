File: setup.html + setup.js

Purpose: Implements the Unattended Setup tab. Guides users through creating automated Windows setup configurations, including system, user, privacy, network, partition, and app settings.

Key UI Elements (HTML):
- Sidebar navigation for setup sections
- Forms for system/user/network/partition/app settings
- Template buttons (Basic, Gaming, Office, Developer)
- Export buttons (JSON, XML)

Styling:
- Multi-panel navigation with progress
- Responsive forms and controls

JavaScript Functionality (setup.js):
- `initSetupTab()`: Initializes all setup UI, navigation, export, and templates.
- Navigation: sidebar and next/prev buttons for multi-step forms.
- Dynamic form sections for network/partition options.
- App chips for quick selection.
- Config templates: apply pre-defined setups.
- Export: gathers form data and exports as JSON/XML for unattended installs.
- Exports `window.initSetupTab` for tab initialization.

Notes:
- Designed for IT pros and advanced users automating Windows deployments. Heavy use of dynamic DOM manipulation and Electron API for integration.
