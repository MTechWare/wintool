File: automation.html + automation.js

Purpose: Implements the Automation & Scripting tab. Allows users to schedule tasks, run batch scripts, and execute PowerShell scripts within the app.

Key UI Elements (HTML):
- Task Scheduler UI (view, refresh, create, manage tasks)
- Batch Script Runner (editor, save/load, run, output)
- PowerShell Console (editor, run, output)
- Modal for creating/editing scheduled tasks

Styling:
- Accent color for icons and buttons
- Responsive design for controls and editors

JavaScript Functionality (automation.js):
- `initAutomationTab()`: Initializes the tab, sets up all main sections and event listeners.
- Task Scheduler: Load, render, run, edit, delete, and create scheduled tasks (with Electron API or mock fallback).
- Batch Script Runner: Editor, save/load, run batch scripts, output handling.
- PowerShell Console: Editor, save/load, run PowerShell scripts, output handling.
- Modal management for task creation/editing.
- Dynamic updates and notifications for all actions.

Notes:
- Complex, multi-section tab for advanced users and automation workflows. Heavy use of Electron API for system integration.
