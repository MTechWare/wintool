File: settings.html + settings.js

Purpose: Implements the Settings tab. Allows users to customize the application's appearance, behavior, and manage tab visibility/pinning.

Key UI Elements (HTML):
- Theme selector (light/dark)
- Accent color picker (with live preview/reset)
- Sidebar fold toggle
- FPS counter toggle
- Always-on-top toggle
- Tab visibility and pinning manager

Styling:
- Uses accent color for primary theme
- Responsive controls and toggles

JavaScript Functionality (settings.js):
- `initSettingsTab()`: Initializes all settings controls, loads/saves preferences to localStorage, applies changes.
- Accent color picker and reset: live updates, persists to storage, reloads UI.
- Toggles for sidebar, FPS, always-on-top: updates UI and persists state.
- Tab visibility/pinning: dynamically manages available tabs (with toggles and switches).
- `setupTabVisibilityManager()`: Builds and manages tab visibility/pin controls and event listeners.
- Exports `window.initSettingsTab` for tab initialization.

Notes:
- Integrates with Electron API for window-level settings. All user preferences are persistent.
