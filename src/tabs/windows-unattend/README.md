## Best Practices

### Security Considerations
1. **Strong Passwords**: Use complex passwords for administrator accounts
2. **Credential Security**: Unattend files contain plain-text passwords
3. **Temporary Accounts**: Use temporary domain accounts for joining
4. **File Security**: Protect unattend.xml files with appropriate permissions
5. **Testing**: Always test in virtual machines before production

### Deployment Recommendations
1. **Backup Data**: Always backup before using disk partitioning
2. **Hardware Compatibility**: Verify hardware compatibility with security bypasses
3. **Network Testing**: Test Wi-Fi profiles and proxy settings
4. **Script Validation**: Thoroughly test custom scripts
5. **Documentation**: Document configurations for future reference

### Performance Optimization
1. **Minimal Scripts**: Keep custom scripts lightweight
2. **Efficient Partitioning**: Use appropriate partition sizes
3. **Network Optimization**: Configure proxy settings for faster downloads
4. **App Removal**: Remove unnecessary apps to improve performance

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Installation Fails**: Check disk partitioning settings and hardware compatibility
2. **Domain Join Fails**: Verify credentials and network connectivity
3. **Scripts Don't Execute**: Check script syntax and execution policies
4. **Wi-Fi Not Connecting**: Verify SSID, security type, and password

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode (Ctrl+Shift+D) for detailed logging and troubleshooting information.

### Error Reporting
Use the built-in error reporting system to export detailed error logs for analysis.

## Advanced Usage

### Custom Configuration Passes
Advanced users can enable custom configuration pass management to control exactly when components are applied during installation.
