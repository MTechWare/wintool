## 🧩 Tab System Architecture

WinTool Portable uses a modular tab system where each tool is a self-contained module:

```
src/tabs/
├── system-info/          # Real-time system monitoring
├── system-utilities/     # Windows administrative tools
├── services/            # Windows service management
├── packages/            # Package management via winget
├── networking/          # Network interface monitoring
├── cleanup/             # System cleanup and optimization
├── environment-variables/ # Environment variable management
└── windows-unattend/    # Windows unattend file creation
```

Each tab contains:
- **config.json** - Tab metadata and configuration
- **index.html** - Tab content and interface
- **styles.css** - Tab-specific styling
- **script.js** - Tab functionality and logic

This modular approach allows for easy maintenance, updates, and potential future expansion.
