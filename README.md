- **🔒 Secure Plugin System**: Extend WinTool’s functionality by creating or installing plugins. The plugin system is built with security at its core, featuring:
    - **Sandboxed Script Execution**: Plugins can only run scripts located inside their own folder.
    - **Isolated Data Storage**: Each plugin has its own private storage, preventing data tampering.
    - **User-Mediated File Access**: Plugins must ask for user permission to read or write files.
- **🎨 Customizable UI**: Tailor the look and feel of the application with themes, including light, dark, and custom color schemes. Adjust window opacity for a modern look.
- ** portability Portable Mode**: No installation required. Run WinTool from a USB drive or any directory.
- **⌨️ Keyboard-Driven Navigation**: Use a command palette (`Ctrl+F`) and keyboard shortcuts for quick access to every tool and feature.

## 🧩 Modular Architecture

WinTool is designed with a modular architecture, separating the core tools from community-driven plugins.

- **Core Tools**: Located in the `src/tabs/` directory. Each tool is a self-contained module with its own HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a `config.json` file for metadata.
- **Plugin System**: Plugins are stored in the `\AppData\Local\MTechTool\Plugins` directory. Each plugin includes a `plugin.json` manifest, UI files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`), and an optional `backend.js` for advanced functionality.

---

## 🔧 Configuration

WinTool stores its settings in the `%APPDATA%/WinTool/settings.json` file.

You can customize:
- **Theme and Colors**
- **Window Transparency**
- **Auto-refresh Intervals**
- **Tab Layout**
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**
- **Startup Behavior**
