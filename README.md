- **üîí Secure Plugin System**: Extend WinTool‚Äôs functionality by creating or installing plugins. The plugin system is built with security at its core, featuring:
    - **Sandboxed Script Execution**: Plugins can only run scripts located inside their own folder.
    - **Isolated Data Storage**: Each plugin has its own private storage, preventing data tampering.
    - **User-Mediated File Access**: Plugins must ask for user permission to read or write files.
- **üé® Customizable UI**: Tailor the look and feel of the application with themes, including light, dark, and custom color schemes. Adjust window opacity for a modern look.
- ** portability Portable Mode**: No installation required. Run WinTool from a USB drive or any directory.
- **‚å®Ô∏è Keyboard-Driven Navigation**: Use a command palette (`Ctrl+F`) and keyboard shortcuts for quick access to every tool and feature.

## üîå Plugin System

Extend WinTool's functionality with a simple and powerful plugin system. Plugins can add new tabs, access system information securely, and introduce custom logic for new tools.

### Key Features

- **Simple Development**: Create plugins with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Backend Scripts**: Use a `backend.js` file for more complex operations with Node.js modules.
- **Easy Installation**: Install plugins by selecting a `.zip` file from the Settings panel.

### Installing Plugins

1.  Navigate to the **Plugins** tab.
2.  Click **"Install Plugin"** and select your plugin's `.zip` package.
3.  The application will prompt for a restart to complete the installation.

For developers, see the [Plugin Development Guide](PLUGIN_DEVELOPMENT.md).

## üé® UI Component Guide

To ensure a consistent look and feel, plugins are encouraged to use the application's built-in UI components. These styles are available automatically to your plugin.

### Buttons (`.btn`)

Use for any action a user can take.

- **Primary Action**: `.btn .btn-primary` (e.g., "Run", "Save")
- **Secondary Action**: `.btn .btn-secondary` (e.g., "Cancel", "Export")
- **Success Action**: `.btn .btn-success` (e.g., "Add", "Start")
- **Destructive Action**: `.btn .btn-danger` (e.g., "Delete", "Stop")

**Example:**
```html
<button class="btn btn-primary">
    <i class="fas fa-play"></i> Run Script
</button>
```

### Cards

Cards are used to group related content into modular blocks.

**Example:**
```html
<div class="plugin-card">
    <div class="plugin-card-header">
        <i class="fas fa-cogs"></i>
        <h4>My Awesome Plugin</h4>
    </div>
    <p>This is a description of what my plugin does.</p>
    <div class="plugin-card-footer">
        <span>Version 1.0.0</span>
        <span>by Developer</span>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Forms

Use these classes to create styled inputs for collecting user data.

- **Container**: `.form-group`
- **Text Input**: `.form-input`
- **Dropdown**: `.settings-select`
- **Checkbox**: `.settings-checkbox`

**Example:**
```html
<div class="form-group">
    <label for="my-input">My Setting</label>
    <input type="text" id="my-input" class="form-input" placeholder="Enter a value...">
</div>
```

### Modals

Modals are used to display content or forms in a focused overlay. You will need to use JavaScript to toggle the `display` style between `none` and `flex` to show and hide them.

**Example:**
```html
<div id="my-modal" class="modal" style="display: none;">
    <div class="modal-content">
        <div class="modal-header">
            <h3>My Modal</h3>
            <button class="modal-close" onclick="hideModal()">&times;</button>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-body">
            <p>This is the content of my modal.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="modal-footer">
            <button class="btn btn-secondary" onclick="hideModal()">Close</button>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

### Tables

The application uses custom-styled tables per tab (e.g., `.services-table`). It's recommended to define a simple table style in your plugin's own `styles.css` for consistency.

---

## üéØ Quick Start

1. **Launch WinTool**: Run the executable (WinTool.exe).
2. **Explore the Dashboard**: Start with the Welcome tab for an overview.
3. **Customize Your Experience**: Open Settings to personalize the appearance and behavior.
4. **Access System Tools**: Use the sidebar or `Ctrl+F` to find and use the various system tools.

---

## üß© Modular Architecture

WinTool is designed with a modular architecture, separating the core tools from community-driven plugins.

- **Core Tools**: Located in the `src/tabs/` directory. Each tool is a self-contained module with its own HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a `config.json` file for metadata.
- **Plugin System**: Plugins are stored in the `\AppData\Local\MTechTool\Plugins` directory. Each plugin includes a `plugin.json` manifest, UI files (`index.html`, `styles.css`, `script.js`), and an optional `backend.js` for advanced functionality.

---

## üîß Configuration

WinTool stores its settings in the `%APPDATA%/WinTool/settings.json` file.

You can customize:
- **Theme and Colors**
- **Window Transparency**
- **Auto-refresh Intervals**
- **Tab Layout**
- **Keyboard Shortcuts**
- **Startup Behavior**
